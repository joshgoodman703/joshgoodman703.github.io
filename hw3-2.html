    <h2>My favorite episode:</h2>
    <p style = "font-family: Arial">Lets dive into a classic Seinfeld episode. This episode is called
        "The Chicken Roaster", and it is the 8th episode of the 8th season
        of the show. At this point in the show, you are introduced to the
        various character personalities. Elaine is carefree, hardworking,
        and often gets her way, George seems to have everything go wrong for
        him, Jerry is the voice of reason, and Kramer is an oddball
        character. In this episode, we see the creators do something very
        unique, and actually play on the personalities of the characters of
        the show. Instead of landing each of them in their typical role
        within some zany situation, this episode "switches" the
        personalities of the characters, causing George and Elaine to swap
        their bad and good luck respectively, as well as forcing Jerry and
        Kramer to swap which one of them is calm versus crazy. Jerry and
        Kramer are forced to switch apartments when Kramer complains about
        light from a chicken restaurant. This causes Jerry to go mad, while
        Kramer starts to develop a sense of calm and reasonability. When
        Jerry finds out that Kramer actually likes the chicken restaurant
        and has been eating it this whole time, he freaks out, showing a
        moment of crazy that Jerry would never display in his typical state.
        It is episodes like this that allow the show to still be funny, even
        in its 8th season.
