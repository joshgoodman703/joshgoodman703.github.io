    <p style="font-family: Arial">I would love to introduce you to the world of Seinfeld, 
        a series of misadventures with Jerry Seinfeld, George Costanza, 
        Elaine Bennis, and Cosmo Kramer. This show, directed and produced 
        by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, set the precedent for the modern 
        situational comedy (sitcom). When it debuted in 1989, it was not
        expected to be the massive hit that it became. The show has a very
        simple concept - "nothing" happens. Of course, that does not mean
        that we are following a series of people sitting and twiddling
        their thumbs, rather we are not expecting one singular plot to drive 
        the entire show. It was uncommon at the time for a show to be
        based purely on the everyday happenings of individuals. For that
        reason, Seinfeld became popular simply based on the idea that there
        was not a significant or overarching storyline that drove each
        episode. Instead, each episode had its own storyline or set of
        storylines that drove the plot. By next week, everything from the
        prior episode is cleared up, and there is a new set of events that
        transpire. This truly was the jumping off point for the modern
        sitcom, making Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David regarded as the first
        movers and architects of this space. </p>
